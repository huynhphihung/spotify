Sing me to sleep Remember me now, time cannot erase I can hear your whispers in my mind I've become what you cannot embrace Our memory will be my lullaby Sing me to sleep now Sing me to sleep Won't you sing me to sleep now? Sing me to sleep A-anytime I would do Time away Yesterday-day A-anytime I would do Time away Yesterday-day",

Where are you now? Was it all in my fantasy? Where are you now? Were you only imaginary? Where are you now? Atlantis Under the sea Under the sea Where are you now? Another dream The monster's running wild inside of me I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded These shallow waters never met what I needed I'm letting go a deeper dive Eternal silence of the sea, I'm breathing Alive Where are you now? Where are you now? Under the bright but faded lights You've set my heart on fire Where are you now? Where are you now? Where are you now? Atlantis Under the sea Under the sea Where are you now? Another dream The monster's running wild inside of me I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded",

Legends never die, they become a part of you Every time you bleed for reaching greatness Relentless you survive They never lose hope when everything's cold And the fighting's near It's deep in their bones They'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce Oh, pick yourself up 'cause Legends never die when the world is calling you Can you hear them screamin' out your name? Legends never die, they become a part of you Every time you bleed for reaching greatness Legends never die They're written down in eternity But you'll never see the price it costs - the scars collected all their lives When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream Oh, pick yourself up 'cause Legends never die when the world is calling you Can you hear them screamin' out your name? Legends never die, they become a part of you Every time you bleed for reaching greatness Legends never die When the world is callin' out your name Begging you to fight Pick yourself up once more Pick yourself up 'cause Legends never die when the world is calling you Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
